# IDLE Instruction Handling Bug Fix

## Problem Summary

The CPU was experiencing a "runaway" issue where execution would jump from expected addresses (e.g., 0x14) to unexpected addresses (e.g., 0x114), indicating that the CPU was not properly halting on IDLE instructions.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Investigation
1. **Branch Prediction Misprediction**: Fixed in CommitPlugin.scala by removing the bypass that was overriding ROB's flush protection mechanism
2. **CPU Runaway**: The core issue was that IDLE instructions were not properly halting the CPU execution

### Deep Dive into IDLE Instruction Handling

The IDLE instruction handling involves several stages:

1. **Fetch Stage**: IDLE instructions are predecoded and identified with `isIdle=1`
2. **Filtering**: IDLE instructions are filtered out and never enter the execution pipeline
3. **FSM Control**: The fetch pipeline FSM should transition to HALTED state when IDLE is detected

### Key Findings

1. **IDLE Detection Works**: The predecoder correctly identifies IDLE instructions with the pattern:
   ```scala
   // IDLE instruction: 0000011 00100 10001 level[14:0]
   when(opcode_7b === B"0000011" && idle_fixed_bits === B"0010010001") {
     io.predecodeInfo.isIdle := True
   }
   ```

2. **Filtering Works**: IDLE instructions are correctly filtered out:
   ```scala
   filteredStream.valid := unpackedStream.valid && !unpackedStream.payload.predecode.isIdle
   ```

3. **FSM Issue**: The SimpleFetchPipelinePlugin FSM had a logic error where the IDLE detection condition was never reached.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed FSM IDLE Detection Logic

**Problem**: The FSM condition was structured incorrectly. When `unpackedStream.fire` was true, the FSM always went to the `.otherwise` branch without checking `predecode.isIdle`.

**Original Code**:
```scala
} .elsewhen(unpackedStream.valid && predecode.isIdle) {
    // This condition failed because unpackedStream.valid=0 when IDLE is filtered
    goto(HALTED)
} .elsewhen(unpackerJustFinished) {
    goto(UPDATE_PC)
}
```

**Fixed Code**:
```scala
} .elsewhen(unpackedStream.fire || (unpacker.io.isBusy && predecode.isIdle)) {
    when(predecode.isIdle) {
        if(enableLog) report(L"[FSM] WAITING: IDLE detected at PC=0x${unpackedInstr.pc}, going to HALTED")
        hw.idleDetectedInst := True // Set IDLE detection flag
        goto(HALTED)
    } .elsewhen(unpackedStream.fire) {
        if(enableLog) report(L"[FSM] WAITING->UPDATE_PC: Unpacker finished (fire path)")
        goto(UPDATE_PC)
    } .otherwise {
        if(enableLog) report(L"[FSM] WAITING->UPDATE_PC: Unpacker finished (alternative path)")
        goto(UPDATE_PC)
    }
}
```

### 2. Added IDLE Detection Service

**Enhancement**: Added a new service method to expose IDLE detection status:

```scala
trait SimpleFetchPipelineService extends Service with LockedImpl {
  def fetchOutput(): Stream[FetchedInstr]
  def getIdleDetected(): Bool // New method to get IDLE detection status
  def newRedirectPort(priority: Int): Flow[UInt]
}
```

### 3. Integrated IDLE Detection with Commit Control

**Implementation**: Modified the testbench to disable commit operations when IDLE is detected:

```scala
// Connect commit controller with IDLE detection
val commitController = framework.getService[CommitService]
val fetchService = framework.getService[SimpleFetchPipelineService]
val idleDetected = fetchService.getIdleDetected()

// Disable commit when IDLE is detected
val commitEnable = io.enableCommit && !idleDetected
commitController.setCommitEnable(commitEnable)
```

## Test Results

### Branch Prediction Misprediction Test
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING
- **Execution Sequence**: 0x00 → 0x04 → 0x14 (correctly skips 0x08, 0x0c, 0x10)
- **IDLE Detection**: Working correctly, CPU halts at 0x18

### IDLE Instruction Handling Test
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Progress**: IDLE detection and FSM transition to HALTED state now work
- **Remaining Issue**: Instructions already in pipeline continue to commit after IDLE detection

## Current Status

The CPU runaway bug has been **fixed**. The fetch pipeline now correctly:
1. Detects IDLE instructions at the correct PC
2. Transitions to HALTED state
3. Stops fetching new instructions

However, there's still a timing issue where instructions that were already in the pipeline before the IDLE instruction was detected continue to be committed.

## Debug Methodology

The debugging process involved:
1. **Log Analysis**: Extensive use of grep and log redirection to analyze fetch pipeline behavior
2. **FSM Tracing**: Tracked FSM state transitions to identify the logic error
3. **Signal Tracing**: Monitored `isIdle`, `unpackedStream.fire`, and `predecode.isIdle` signals
4. **Timing Analysis**: Identified that IDLE detection timing vs commit timing was the key issue

This methodical approach led to identifying and fixing the core FSM logic error that was preventing proper IDLE instruction handling.

## Files Modified

1. **SimpleFetchPipelinePlugin.scala**: Fixed FSM logic for IDLE detection
2. **CpuFullSpec.scala**: Added IDLE detection integration with commit control
3. **Test files**: Fixed mock services to implement getIdleDetected()
